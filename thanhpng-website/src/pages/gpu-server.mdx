# GPU Server SSH Tutorial

For machine learning applications, Prof. Charles Wang left our class a 2017 Titan Xp GPU Server for training. Training machine learning models can be extremely time consuming and resource gating for personal computers. Not to mention, machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow, are optimized for NVidia Cuda cores. Developing on remote machines in the past used to be a pain, but now with IDEs like VSCode, we can work on code on remote servers as if they were running on our personal machines. To do this we will need to complete the following steps.

1. Create an `.ssh/config` file with all of Temple's servers that we wish to tunnel through.
2. Create an ssh key and add it to each server so that we don't need to type in a password everytime we change code.
3. git clone your project on the `cis-wangstu1` server using another ssh key so that we can commit and push code to GitHub without personal access tokens.
4. Setup VSCode for remote code editing.

## 1. SSH config file

On your Mac or Linux PC, open up your terminal and run the following command (unless you already have an `.ssh/config` file.)

```
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

This command creates an empty `config` text file. Next we will populate it with the list of Temple Servers.

Use `nano` or any text editor you prefer to copy and paste the following.

```config
Host cis-linux2.temple.edu
  HostName cis-linux2.temple.edu
  User tul20076
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host tec2.hpc.temple.edu
  HostName tec2.hpc.temple.edu
  User tul20076
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host wang
  HostName cis-wangstu1
  ProxyJump cis-linux2.temple.edu
  User tul20076
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Of course replace your `User` name with your AccessNet name.

Next, notice that we have an `IdentityFile` listed in the `config` file. This is the path to our ssh key, but we haven't actually created this yet. We do this by running `ssh-keygen`.

## 2. Create SSH Key and add it to each server.

```shell
ssh-keygen
```

```shell title="save your key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/thanhnguyen/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

You can skip all of the steps by hitting enter.

```shell title="successful creation of key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/thanhnguyen/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/thanhnguyen/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:kxdpmge4naR5MduBlrGu5ndLACgQ5sL6VpgkjuTz81A thanhnguyen@Thanh-Nguyen-MacBook-Pro.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|oo      .        |
|+.   . . = .     |
|o+o . o X =      |
|Bo +   X % o     |
|o+o .E+ S +      |
| .o..  o =       |
|  o+  o   .      |
| .  +o  ...      |
|     ... ...     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

:::warning MacOS Ventura
If you are on MacOS Ventura or above you'll need to edit your Mac's ssh config file using `sudo` privlages. [See OSXDaily's _How to Fix SSH Not Working on MacOS Ventura_.](https://osxdaily.com/2022/12/22/fix-ssh-not-working-macos-rsa-issue/)
:::

Now we need to copy this key to each server, this part is tedious, but worth it. We need to run `ssh-copy-id` on `cis-linux2`, and `cis-wangstu1` in that order.

:::tip SSH Key from 3296
If you already have an SSH key setup from the 3296 Software Design course, you can just use that one and copy it to `cis-wangstu1`.
:::

<p>You'll be prompted to enter your password after running each command.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cis-linux2.temple.edu`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </li>
  <li>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub tec2.hpc.temple.edu`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </li>
  <li>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub wang`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </li>
</ol>

You should now be able to freely ssh into each server without a password. Try it!

Now lets clone the project repository on `cis-wangstu1`.

## 3. git clone the repo on the GPU Server

First we need to ssh into `cis-wangstu1`.

```bash
ssh wang
```

You should see the following to know that you are logged into the correct server.

```
#######
#       #    # #####  ######  ####  #####    ##### #    # ######
#        #  #  #    # #      #    #   #        #   #    # #
#####     ##   #    # #####  #        #        #   ###### #####
#         ##   #####  #      #        #        #   #    # #
#        #  #  #      #      #    #   #        #   #    # #
####### #    # #      ######  ####    #        #   #    # ######

#     #
#     # #    # ###### #    # #####  ######  ####  ##### ###### #####
#     # ##   # #       #  #  #    # #      #    #   #   #      #    #
#     # # #  # #####    ##   #    # #####  #        #   #####  #    #
#     # #  # # #        ##   #####  #      #        #   #      #    #
#     # #   ## #       #  #  #      #      #    #   #   #      #    #
 #####  #    # ###### #    # #      ######  ####    #   ###### #####
```

Next we will create another ssh key that will be used to clone the GitHub repository securely.

```shell
ssh-keygen
```

```shell title="save your key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/thanhnguyen/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

You can skip all of the steps by hitting enter.

```shell title="successful creation of key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/thanhnguyen/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/thanhnguyen/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:kxdpmge4naR5MduBlrGu5ndLACgQ5sL6VpgkjuTz81A thanhnguyen@Thanh-Nguyen-MacBook-Pro.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|oo      .        |
|+.   . . = .     |
|o+o . o X =      |
|Bo +   X % o     |
|o+o .E+ S +      |
| .o..  o =       |
|  o+  o   .      |
| .  +o  ...      |
|     ... ...     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

You'll need to copy your public key to your clipboard.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value={1} label={"using pbcopy"}>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {"pbcopy < /Users/YOUR_USER_DIRECTORY/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={2} label={"using cat"}>
    <CodeBlock language="bash" title={"manually copy the output"}>
      {"cat /Users/YOUR_USER_DIRECTORY/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With your public key copied to your clipboard login to https://github.com
Tap on your profile in the top right corner as seen in [Figure 1.1](#figure-1) and click Settings. You will then navigate to the _SSH and GPG Keys_ menu on the Settings page. click ["New SSH Key"](#figure-1--2) and paste your public key that should be on your clipboard.

import navSettings from "../../static/img/navigate-settings-1-1.png";
import navToKeys from "../../static/img/navigate-settings-1-2.png";
import addImg from "../../static/img/navigate-settings-1-3.png";
import clone from "../../static/img/navigate-settings-1-4.png";

<Figure
  src={navSettings}
  caption={"Figure 1.1 Navigate to Settings page."}
  id={"figure-1"}
/>
<Figure
  src={navToKeys}
  caption={"Figure 1.2 Navigate to SSH and GPG Keys."}
  id={"figure-1--2"}
/>
<Figure src={addImg} caption={"Figure 1.3 Paste SSH Key."} id={"figure-1--3"} />

You may now clone your projects using SSH.

<Figure
  src={clone}
  caption={
    "Figure 1.4 Clone the repository making sure that you selected the SSH tab."
  }
  id={"figure-1--4"}
/>

```
git clone git@github.com:Capstone-Projects-2023-Spring/project-YOUR-PROJECT.git
```

## 3. VSCode Remote Code editing

In VSCode, install the ["Visual Studio Code Remote ‚Äì SSH" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) by Microsoft. Once installed you will then use it to connect to the GPU Server by clicking the bottom left corner as seen in [Figure 2.1](#figure-2--1), and then clicking `wang` from the list of connections as seen in [Figure 2.2](#figure-2--2) (please note in the image it shows `chinook` not `wang`).

import vsCodeConnectHost from "../../static/img/vscode-connect-to-host1.png";
import vsCodeConnectChinook from "../../static/img/vscode-connect-to-host2.png";

<Figure
  src={vsCodeConnectHost}
  caption="Figure 2.1 VSCode Connect to host button."
  id={"figure-2--1"}
/>
<Figure
  src={vsCodeConnectChinook}
  caption="Figure 2.2 Connect to server."
  id={"figure-2--2"}
/>

You should now be able to clone and open folders on the server using the VSCode interface. üë®‚Äçüíª
